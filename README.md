This application tracks your employees. 

## How to run the program:

You can go to Github (see the link, above) and run it that way, or follow the following steps to run it on your local machine:

1) Open an integrated terminal in the root directory of your project, but it should be the same directory where the
    server.js file lies
2) Type "npm i" to install the dependencies
3) Type "npm start" to start the React application

4) Simply load the page, and then you can filter by employee name.  Start typing the name in the textbox in the upper left hand corner, and you'll see the list upate itself with employee names that match what you're typing.  You can also sort by age.  Just click the sort button to click on ascending order first, then click again to sort by descending order.

## How to test this app

Follow the steps above to run the program.  Make sure the names are being filtered.  Also, make sure the sorting works.
